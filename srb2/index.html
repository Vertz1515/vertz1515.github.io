      <p>Hello everybody, this is (Hopefully) going to be my primary hosting platform, next step is probably a <br> real proper website domain! <br> I'm just very happy that I finally here.></p>
        <p>I have been searching for a relyable place to host my content for admittidly 3 years in one way or another into 2021, when I started! <br> It started out with wix... kinda... I just heard about it on YouTube and I felt like it was a good place to make a website abput myself.</p>
      <p>I quickly realized that wix wasn't really for me and I honestly don't remember why... But it was still a step forward. <br> Next step was Google Sites. And I had actually gone a <br> pretty
      decently far way with Google Sites, even to where I host my Scratch Sonic website there. But honestly, I didn't really care for it <br> for serious hosting, all you could really host was images and a few types of google drive files</p>
      <br>
      <p>This got pretty annoying when I started creating Rom Hacks and there was just no simple and quick way to host it... <br> best I could get were very long URLs that often required you to physically press a download <br> button. Who wants to do that? <br> <br> next step was Neocites, I thought maybe if I picked a traditional HTML website builder, I would've had more freedom with what I could host... WRONG <br> I could only host image and text files which is pretty much the exact opposite of what somebody who has not so standard file formats wants. <br> but I actually went along with it quite well and just kept going <br> <br
And that leads to today, when I finally decided to go the github route and start hosting here, I am finally happy that I can use this as a primary place to host all of my files, in fact this website is based off of my Neocites site funny enough...
