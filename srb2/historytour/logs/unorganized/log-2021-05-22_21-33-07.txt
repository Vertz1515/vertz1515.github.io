<~ImpatientHedgehog15> There was a game called Sonic Robo Blast 1.5 made by a friend of the developers
<Gamerboytin> Wtf
*TAS 20FF has joined the game (player 1)
<Suit> Can you download it or no
<TAS 20FF> hi
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> you can't SSN gave me the link
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> it's a modified version of srb1 xmas
<Suit> Is it a wad, pk3, or separate executeable
*snoccy has joined the game (player 3)
<Suit> Themed to be normal?
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> yeah... in a way
<Gamerboytin> Did it use SRB2TGF assets?
<Suit> Improvements to any extent?
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> it used xtreme sprites
<Suit> That sounds like it would look off
*TAS 20FF left the game
<Suit> Unless the perspective is set right
<Gamerboytin> XTreme sprites would clash in with the enviroment
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> the enviornment was hand drawn
<Gamerboytin> Sonic's sprites were the same as SRB1Xmas, or XTreme?
*Zantru has joined the game (player 5)
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> xtreme
Suit has completed the level.
<Gamerboytin> SPRITE CLASH ALERT!
<Suit> Anything else interesting?
ImpatientHedgehog15 has completed the level.
<Gamerboytin> Ah yes, U N K N O W N
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> I didn't tell you that Mach made it
<Suit> I mean like, in terms of other things interesting
<Suit> Do you have a working copy of emerald quest
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> Yes
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> I do
<Suit> And if so, does it feature any appearence of knuckles
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> It's very primative though
<Suit> Or is it just sonic
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> just sonic
<Suit> Well
<Suit> Ill let you in on somethin
<Suit> im making a pk3 pack of 3 characters
<Gamerboytin> What if the devs of XTreme didn't release the sprites, then what would SSNTails use? SegaSonic Arcade Sprites?
<Suit> sonic, tails, and knuckles, all taking from the old games
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> like the genesis gameas
<Suit> Sonic doom 2 tails, Quake sonic (now gonna be quake knuckles) and emerald quest sonic
<Gamerboytin> What about SD2 Sonic, Knuckles and Metal Sonic?
<Suit> sonic doom 2 tails is done, quakehog is dumb and im gonna just do knuckles, he could be controlled by only gliding since thats all he does in sonic quake
<Suit> Im just making the trio
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> emerald quest sonic is just the one used in the old THZ cutscene
<Suit> Does it have enough sprites to where it can be like
<Suit> something worth while
<Gamerboytin> So basically E. Sonic?
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> just sonic walking forward
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> a midi of Diamond Dust act 2 
<Suit> I think im gonna have to see
<snoccy> why can i only play about this cursed creature
<Suit> if its styled like the big sprites in the cutscene, i can cope
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> yes
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> it is
<Suit> i have cutouts of half the arms shaded and tilted in certain ways
<Suit> so i can bend any piece of ssntails sonic art into whatever i please
<Suit> And some leg cutouts
$exitlevel
<snoccy> oh ok

Map is now "MAP08: DEEP SEA Zone 2"
<Gamerboytin> Remember SSNTails' Wizard Needs Food Badly?
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> yes
<snoccy> oh cool halloween sonic
<Suit> Do you want a rundown of how the characters that are done work?
<Gamerboytin> Funni
<snoccy> early sonic is cute
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> ok
<Suit> Sonic doom 2 tails and quakehog work, but quakehog is just stupid
<snoccy> A
<Gamerboytin> HIS LIFE ICON IS HUGE
<snoccy> oh
<Suit> Sonic doom 2 tails is a very heavy modification of tails guy
<snoccy> thats because
<Suit> That has only one gun
*Lonote has joined the game (player 1)
<Suit> The infamous red gun sonic holds in doom 2
<snoccy> he's a legacy
<Suit> And also, is the base walk speed of doom guy
<Gamerboytin> You just need to get permission from Tripel first...
<Suit> Yeah
<Suit> Thats why its not released yet
<Gamerboytin> Sage 2000 DSZ?!
<snoccy> also he's from the seriously old versions of the sonic robo blast series
<Suit> Its been like 2 months since ive finished it and i just dont have the balls to ask him
*Lonote left the game
<Suit> Cause i feel like im nothing
<Suit> But then i realise ive completely overhauled tails guy and that itspretty cool
<Gamerboytin> Funni F12 for funni Sage 2000 thing
<snoccy> how come no one has ported 2.1 knuckles yet?
<Suit> cause it removes every single gun except the shotgun, its modified to only shoot one singular projectile, and you can only really get good air momentum
<Suit> cause he is pretty much 2.2 knuckles, but less fat
<Gamerboytin> I saw a port of Chuckles in Mari0shi's Server
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> I ported Xtreme sonic, and it took like... the majority of the day
<snoccy> yeah thats because mari0shi ported it for his server
<Suit> oh and sd2tails other gimmick is the jump boost ability
<Suit> He can gain broken heights when you get speed from slopes
<Suit> and he cant drown
<snoccy> why did srb2 use extreme sprites?
NOTICE: You can't change your skin at the moment.
NOTICE: You can't change your skin at the moment.
NOTICE: You can't change your skin at the moment.
<Suit> I just wanna ask something real quick
<Suit> have you met tripel or no
<snoccy> a bunch of lost sprites
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> yeah?
<snoccy> or whatever its called
<snoccy> njkltgnjhwghwgh
<Suit> Would he be mad or deny sd2tails on the spot or no
<snoccy> sd2tails?
<Suit> sonic doom 2 tails
<Suit> a heavy modification of tails guy i made
<snoccy> oh
<Gamerboytin> Why is gliding the only thing Quakechidna can do?
<Suit> its pretty fun, but i feel like me just asking out of the blue to use it when its already done might make me seem like an idiot
<snoccy> are you talking about the one where sonic looked like earless or no?
<Gamerboytin> Hmm, Demo Chao?
<Suit> i just realised i forgot what i was typing mid way
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> CHAO WAS IN THE XMAS CD FIRST!
<Suit> i meant i feel like me just asking out of the blue to use tails guy assets when ive already used them and heavily modified them makes me look dumb
HMS: connecting 'https://mb.srb2.org/MS/0/servers/217071/update'...
Updated master server listing.
<Suit> not using him
<snoccy> what old versions of srb2 do you like the most?
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> lots of them
<snoccy> i like 2.1
<Suit> 2.1 was very memorable
<Suit> and every single  beta level from the older ports
<Gamerboytin> SRB1, TGF, 1.09.4, 2.0 and 2.1
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> 2.0 was how i started
<Gamerboytin> Plus how it all started
<Suit> there all just this clostrophobic mess that challenges you to NOT go fast
<snoccy> 2.0 is barley playable for me rn
ImpatientHedgehog15 has completed the level.
<snoccy> lol
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> I ported 2.2 sonic to demo 4
<snoccy> wow
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> pain
<snoccy> did he break the game?
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> Kinda
<snoccy> or was he just glitchy
<snoccy> ah
<snoccy> FGRICK
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> I just forgot to give him falling frames
<snoccy> oh lol
<snoccy> god i hate this level
<snoccy> 2.2 deep sea is so much better
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> and the game goes segment violation after using a spring
<snoccy> lol
<snoccy> tbh im thinking of making a mighty mod for 2.2
<Suit> Somebody should
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> I edited the EXE of Xmas 0.96 to make eggman say, "You suck" in his letter to sonci
Suit has completed the level.
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> *sonic
<snoccy> i just gotta find his srb2kart sprites for it tho
$exitlevel
<Gamerboytin> LOL
Speeding off to level...

Speeding off to level...
Map is now "MAP10: CASTLE EGGMAN Zone 1"
<snoccy> i am sooo gonna get lost
<snoccy> what happend to early sonic's thok
<Gamerboytin> Mine Maze and Rocky Mountain?
<Suit> Rocky mountain is pretty neat
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> early sonic didn't thok
<snoccy> wait is this your port or something?
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> it was made from the original od
<snoccy> because in another early sonic mod for 2.2 he can thok
<snoccy> oh
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> *mod
<Gamerboytin> Lance A Bots used to go down in 1 hit
<snoccy> 1.09.4 was weird
<Gamerboytin> SA Example Zone
<snoccy> actually i think demo 2 is weirder
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> yeah
<snoccy> final boss was weird
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> sonikku made the chat sound
<Suit> What is the final boss in this wad?
<Suit> Just brak but with the old map
<snoccy> black eggman
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> hey
Screen shot srb20023.png saved in C:\Users\pcref\Desktop\Fan-games\Spnic Robo Blast 2\2.2.9\screenshots\
<snoccy> also are you talking about the "heya hehe" sound when you chat?
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> yes
<snoccy> oh god that was annoying
<snoccy> what were they THINKING
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> it was intended to be
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> because they tried to voice Louis JM
<snoccy> who?
*garf has joined the game (player 1)
<snoccy> welp im lost
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> Louis JM was a troll from a forum bored they were on
<snoccy> oh
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> he was quite annoying and lots of people hated him
<snoccy> welp im not lost
<snoccy> man i wish i played srb2 during the other versions
<Gamerboytin> H E Y A  H E H E
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> also that same forum bored was where SRB1 version 1.0a was released
<snoccy> H E Y A H E H E
<garf> i hate this
<Gamerboytin> *ringing*
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> act 2 is better
ImpatientHedgehog15 has completed the level.
<snoccy> have you guys ever saw that sadx srb2 mod from 1.09.4 ?
<Gamerboytin> Nope, never heard of it
<snoccy> oh
<snoccy> old srb2 is weird
Zantru has completed the level.
<Gamerboytin> Demo 1?
<snoccy> all demos
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> demo 1 was rused 
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> *rushed
Suit has completed the level.
<snoccy> i can tell
<Gamerboytin> Only GFZ1
<snoccy> they definitley didnt have time to make half of the sprites for the characters
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> ssn pointed out that if I changed GFZrock to the old one, i had a beta
<Suit> i just wanna know if anybody will ever port any level from sonic doom 2
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> i tried...
<garf> even with tails this ain't easy
<Suit> like gfz from that one, the character zones
*garf left the game
<Suit> Like atleast with the sonic zone, tails, or knuckles
<Suit> you have the chance to port it since its just basic colors
snoccy has completed the level.
<Suit> But it would be cool to see the old gfz from that one
<Gamerboytin> Imagine a "The Metal Sonic Zone" lol
<Suit> That would have to be man made
$exitlevel
<snoccy> "metal sonic zone" ?

Updated master server listing.
<snoccy> bruh
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> the cd version of SRB2Xmas
<snoccy> oh
<Gamerboytin> Has this turned into an Old SRB2 discussion?
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> yes
*Sendit0 left the game
<snoccy> yes
<snoccy> 1.09.4 mods are weird
<Suit> Do you plan to replace some sprites with their old counterparts in this or no
<Suit> Or try to make whatever this is (wad or pk3) change the og sonic, tails, and knux to be there 2.1 counterparts, and have the other old characters
<Gamerboytin> I think 2.0 CEZ2 had a signature in one of the areas saying "Sonniku" written in Japanese
<snoccy> was 1.09.4 mods just recolors?
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> most
<snoccy> not surprised
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> imagine drawing 50+ sprites
<Gamerboytin> Not always, there was a Mario mod for 1.09.4 that had mostly edited SMW Sprites
<Suit> i did almost half
<Suit> just to get the arms and legs of most of the sonic art from the art pack that got released
<snoccy> dang it i gotta take a shower soon
<Suit> i need to eat something before i keel over
*lexidog has joined the game (player 1)
<Gamerboytin> Will they bring back 2.1 and 2.0 servers?
<snoccy> i hate this map
<Suit> most likely no
<Gamerboytin> Sad
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> I got lost and went backwards
<lexidog> wdym bring back
<snoccy> same
<Suit> Srb2 2.1s tagline is getting lost
<lexidog> did they disable 2.1 and 2.9 servers from being able to host on the master serve ror something
<lexidog> i dont know what u mean
<lexidog> *2.0
<Suit> master server changes
<lexidog> oh
<Suit> like the boards master server has a new link name now
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> why do you think 2.2.8 stopped working
<Suit> so i think you can host, but it will be really busted and most likely crash
<snoccy> how come in the 2.2 era we have mod beggars and childish people?
<lexidog> what if you edit the config to use the new link
<lexidog> oh
*Spark has joined the game (player 6)
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> because... logic
<lexidog> a
<Suit> And people change
<snoccy> i mean like what did 2.2 did to deserve this
<lexidog> honestly it's not like theres much point hosting a 2.1 or 2.0 server on the ms anyways
<Gamerboytin> You know SRB2Kart, right?
<snoccy> yeah
<Suit> yeah
<lexidog> usually there'd only be like 0 or 1 servr at once, but mostly 0
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> not to mention that youtubers are profiting from making videos on peoples mods 
<lexidog> and the amount of users who would see it
<Suit> Funny thing
<Gamerboytin> Actually, it was originally a Gamemode in SRB2Riders
<Suit> I mostly just see videos of all the sonics people make
<snoccy> i know that
<Suit> But they just add like a couple flags and some new sprites
<snoccy> god i wish dreamcast sonic and sa sonic released
*lexidog left the game
<Gamerboytin> Must... look... at... statue...
<Suit> I should prob get permission from tripel to release sd2tails, and then make quake knuckles and emerald quest sonic
<Gamerboytin> Must not keep eyes off it...
<Suit> so i can release a pretty neat 3 character pack focussed on disability abilities
<snoccy> missing sprites moment

<Suit> besides the fact this is a sonic game and your defaulted to playing as sonic
<Sonic> i just named myself sonic

<Gamerboytin> Hell*

<Gamerboytin> Because when you jump on that house in GFZ1 in Final Demo...
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> after beating it like 5 times
<Suit> I wanna listen to egg rock act 2s midi
<Suit> the old one was really good
Spark has completed the level.
<Suit> well wait
<Suit> hold on
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> metal sonic battle midi
<Gamerboytin> A HUGE banger
<Suit> will the midi songs replace digital or the actual midi
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> slapps
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> midi
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> actual
<Suit> nice
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> because recording all the midis now to make them ogg will take 14 years
ImpatientHedgehog15 has completed the level.
<Suit> I can do that for you if you want
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> no im fine
<Suit> k
<Suit> woah
<Suit> you got the old wave effect working
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> yeah
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> epic
<Suit> Did it take long
<Suit> or no
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> no
<Suit> damn
<Suit> i might actually see if i can try doing the same thing
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> sectors and linedevs in 2.1 and 2.0 are pretty much the same as 2.2 besides slopes and stuff
Suit has completed the level.
<Suit> So everything just worked on the spot
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> yeah
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> exept the tightropes
<Suit> I just wondered
<Suit> is it just like
<Gamerboytin> I attempted to ride the waves
<Suit> sectors moving up and down
<Suit> and it just conveniently syncs
Gamerboytin has completed the level.
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> I don't know
<Suit> or is it something else cool
<Suit> I might look into it
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> It's probably lava opaques
*ThatEeveeBoi has joined the game (player 1)
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> just going up and down
<Suit> yeah i think its opaques
$exitlevel
<Suit> its going through the sectors they have
<ThatEeveeBoi> NO
<ThatEeveeBoi> I WAS GONNA PRESS THEE BUTTON
<Suit> So this is actually something cool i can use
Speeding off to level...
Map is now "MAP63: MP Special Stage 4 Zone"
<Suit> might make a level focused on riding a giant wave or something if i can figure it all out
<Suit> might simplify the effect for gameplay though
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> the slope waves in 2.2 are weird
Speeding off to level...
Map is now "MAP22: EGG ROCK Zone 1"
<Suit> I know how to ride them instantly
<Suit> Its never hard for me to just thok onto the wave and just run the entire way completely unscaved
<ThatEeveeBoi> why isn't this level changed
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> as ssn said to me
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> "time"
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> guys...
<Suit> yeah
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> umm...
