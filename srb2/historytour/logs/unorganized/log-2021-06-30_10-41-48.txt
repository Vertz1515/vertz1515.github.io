Speeding off to level...
Map is now "MAP13: ARID CANYON Zone 1"
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> I added one line to this
<@Suit> if the text context was just that the boss was so hated by players that srb2 2.2 is just incapable of running it
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> clever
<@Suit> cause for some reason the srb2 community just hates gauntlets
<@Suit> lets go see deep sea

Map is now "MAP08: DEEP SEA Zone 2"
<@Suit> wow
<@Suit> i actually got that
<@Suit> did the ropes in arid get fixed?
<@Suit> i just wondered
Speeding off to level...
Map is now "MAP10: CASTLE EGGMAN Zone 1"
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> "normally this would happen" type context
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> no. no matter how hard I tried
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> they looked identical
<@Suit> i have a friend who has a map that has a pointless rope segment
<@Suit> i think its funny that its this weird map with the special stage textures vomitted into it
<@Suit> but he somehow got functional ropes
<@Suit> they arent even ropes in the stage texture context, there blue diamond things you climb on
<@Suit> also
<@Suit> i just wondered
<@Suit> have you released or talked about the xmas cd demo on the mb
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> no, I beleve SSN released it there but I didn't check
<@Suit> Nope
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> ah
<@Suit> i checked all his things a long time ago searching for emerald quest
<@Suit> i think we should release it later on after i do something
<@Suit> i was thinking of taking the drawings of the sprites put into the cd and making hd early sonic
<@Suit> along with finishing tails and making hd early tails
<@Suit> and then put it in one mega pack
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> yeah. Like coloring his original sketches.
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> or something
<@Suit> and also show some little fun facts like the early sonic im playing as has his character icon on the select screen traced from the original drawing snapshot
<@Suit> stick it to that guy for being lucky
<@Suit> another thing related to old stuff
<@Suit> i found out that the old srb2 sprites from the older demos are actually differently colored
<@Suit> so slightly
<@Suit> and the legacy trio has incorrect colors
<~ImpatientHedgehog15> Is it like a differient playpal or something
<@Suit> with only 2 still being in the game
<@Suit> the tails orange is slightly brighter than the one we have now
<@Suit> and that can be fixed by changing the colors to be brighter
<@Suit> the shading was this weird grey (you can see that in kte in some spots since i directly ported and color coded the sprites from the demo when making kte)
