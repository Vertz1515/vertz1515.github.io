        <h2>KNOWN ISSUES AND FIXES</h2>
        <h3>ISSUE #1</h3>
        <li>Objects don't appear in the game automatically.</li>
        <p>FIX<br>Select every object in your map and toggle on the "Easy" "Hard" & "Multiplayer" Flags.</p>
        <h3>ISSUE #2</h3>
        <li>Objects don't appear in normal mode when I enable the flags.</li>
        <p>FIX<br>Open the map in another configuration (Ex: Doom CFG) and toggle the normal flag through there.<br>The normal mode flag was left out in the Demo 4 CFG due to the SRB2 Formatinterface defaulting normal mode to "Flip".</p>
