----------------------------Sonic 1 Encore Edit by Vertobits65---------------------------------------------------------------------------------




-The file called Playing State.gsx is a save state you (HAVE) to use if booting up the game, because a glitch in the rom turns the screen
red upon booting up the game for some reason


-This is the first version of my first REAL rom hack










Have fun - Vertz
