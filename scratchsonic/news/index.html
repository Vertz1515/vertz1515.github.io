        <p style="width: 70%;">Well folks... If you're reading this, then I'm happy to say that my mission was a success! From the moment I setup my website, I knew that the ScratchSonicDownloads Google Site would become VERY obsolete... and right I was on that. The last update was all the way back in 2021... It has long since died, but a select few people may know that I never killed off the project itself. Nope, I've been working on Scratch Sonic 5.00 since July of 2022, which suprisingly was one year ago! I'm very happy to say that progress is going very well and the game is already beginning to look incredible, but there's still a long way to go... Remember when I released a 3.00 preview demo to show off the first 2 levels? Well, I'm thinking of doing it again, don't expect it anytime soon though, because this idea has only been in my mind for a couple days, but maybe... Anyways, sooner or later when I become more confident in this site, I might change most of the links from around Scratch to point here. Another thing that I've been thinking about was a Discord Server, I've been back and fourth on this idea since </p>
